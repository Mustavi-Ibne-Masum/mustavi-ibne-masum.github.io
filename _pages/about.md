<span style="color:black; font-family:Georgia">Greetings!üññüèº</span>

<p style="text-align:justify; color:black; font-family:Georgia">This is Mustavi Ibne Masum. I am working as a Junior Software Engineer at <a href="https://www.rite.com.bd/">RITE Solutions Ltd.</a> I graduated from 
<a href="https://aust.edu/">Ahsanullah University of Science and Technology</a> with a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science and 
Engineering where I also work as a part-time lecturer. My career aspiration is to become both software engineer and scientist doing research in my field. 
I am particularly interested in working on NLP and Vision works. </p>

<!-- Ever since I was a child, I've been incredibly curious, and that curiosity has driven me to want to become a researcher.  -->
While studying Computer Science and Engineering, I completed various projects for my coursework, and that experience made me even more passionate about doing excellent work. As I got closer to graduation, I realized that my interest in research, especially in the field of artificial intelligence (AI), had grown immensely. I'm particularly drawn to areas like natural language processing (NLP) and computer vision. My plan is to explore these subjects deeply and use what I learn to create user-friendly software for everyone to use.</p>
